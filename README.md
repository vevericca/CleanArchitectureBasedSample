--in progress--
Architectural sample for an Android app implementing Clean Architecture with feature-based modules. This structure is ideal for scenarios where features are fully independent, without shared logic or repositories. It promotes scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns by isolating each feature into its own module, encapsulating ui, data and domain logics.
